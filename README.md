# HabitCircle

## About

### Inspiration 💡
Our inspiration for this project comes from the growing concern around mental health, particularly the impact of mental illnesses such as depression on young adults. We aimed to create a platform that not only provides resources but also facilitates communication among families to support their loved ones on their rehabilitation journey. Witnessing the struggles of individuals and families dealing with mental health issues motivated us to build a solution that can make a real difference.

### What We Learned 🧠
Throughout the development of this project, we learned the critical importance of prioritizing the core functionalities before diving into additional features. This approach ensured that our primary goal of supporting families and individuals was effectively met within the given time constraints.

### How We Built Our Project 🏗️
We built our project using a combination of modern web technologies to create a seamless and interactive experience:

- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Firebase**: Used for backend implementation, including real-time database management and user authentication.

### Challenges Faced 💪
One of the significant challenges we faced was prioritizing which features to implement within the limited time frame. With numerous potential features, it was crucial to focus on those that would deliver the most value to our users. Additionally, formulating a cohesive and impactful idea that directly addressed the prompt in a short amount of time required intense brainstorming and quick decision-making.

## Features

### Role-Based Access 👪
Family members can join their family group with designated roles — parent (admin), sibling, caregiver, or child. This structure ensures that everyone in the family has appropriate access and permissions tailored to their role.

### Habit Streak System 🔥
The Habit Streak System encourages consistency and progress with visual streaks and reminders to stay on track. As users maintain their healthy habits over consecutive days, they develop streaks that unlock rewards such as mini-games and a virtual pet.

### Support Groups 🤝
Connect with external support communities and resources for additional advice, shared experiences, and motivation. This feature aims to provide a sense of community and external support, which is crucial for mental health and rehabilitation.

### Resource Library 📚
Access a curated collection of articles, guides, and tools related to rehabilitation and healthy living. The Resource Library is designed to provide valuable information and practical advice to support the rehabilitation process.

## How to Use

1. **Sign Up**: Use your customized key to join your family group.
2. **Dashboard**: Access your dashboard to track healthy habits, view your streaks, and explore unlocked rewards.
3. **Support Groups**: Join support groups to connect with others and share experiences.
4. **Resource Library**: Browse the library for articles, guides, and tools to aid in your rehabilitation journey.

## Technologies Used
